## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm pink (#F289B3), evokes feelings of caring, support, and optimism, avoids the cliche of using red for an emergency app.
- Background color: Light pink (#FCE6F0), same hue as primary but very desaturated, ensures comfortable readability as well as a unified appearance with the primary color.
- Accent color: Peach (#F2B489), different enough from pink to create contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons in pink and peach to maintain consistency.
- Prioritize large, easily tappable buttons and a clear visual hierarchy.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and feedback on actions.
